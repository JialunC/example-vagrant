# Example Vagrant

**Disclaimer: This is not developed by Trilogy**

## Getting Started
1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. Install [Vagrant (1.9.1)](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.9.1/)
3. Clone this repo
4. Open your terminal and type `vagrant up` (from the repo directory). If this is the first time, it will take a bit for ansible to setup your vagrant machine.
5. Remember to run `vagrant halt` to halt the running VM.

**Run `vagrant ssh`(from the repo directory) to SSH into a running Vagrant machine and give you access to a shell.**
**Run `vagrant halt`(from the repo directory) to stop the VM.**
**Run `vagrant destroy`(from the repo directory) to remove the VM**
